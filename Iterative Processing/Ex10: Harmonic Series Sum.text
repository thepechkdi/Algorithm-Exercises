### Harmonic Series Formula

The sum is defined as:

$$
S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i}
$$

This formula represents the partial sum of the harmonic series.



BEGIN
    WRITE "Enter an integer n: "
    READ n

    S = 0

    FOR i ← 1 TO n DO
        S = S + (1 / i)
    END FOR

    WRITE "The sum S = ", S
END
